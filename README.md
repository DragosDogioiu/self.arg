# self.arg

Inspired by Ion Grigorescu’s double exposure boxing and The Doors of Serenity by The Chameleons, self.arg is a tool for a stage performance piece dealing with the inner conflict within a person, as in the above mentioned performances and many others.

In self.arg, an actor is present on a stage and a projection is overlayed over them, mirroring the shape of their body as a dark shadow in a sea of visual noise. 

The title is meant to represent having an argument with the self and is also a programming reference.

The sound component is the key of the performance, as the actor moves his body towards his projected shadow, the intensity of the background noise increases, creating a dynamic, multi-layered experimental music composition. The more the actor chooses to face his “darker side”, the more chaotic the sound is. The type of movements is up to the performer as well as any spoken dialogue they see fit. 

The sound is handled by MaxMSP and Posent, while a TouchDesigner file is responsible for the visuals. 

In order to run the performance properly you will need 2 cameras. Run the Max patch and the TD file, make sure each uses a separate webcam.
